# Tabletop-Companion
Settlers of Catan is a strategy game where you have discovered new an uncharted island named Catan, but you aren’t the only ones to land here, race other players to settle the island. You build roads and new settlements that eventually become cities.  

The game is a scramble for resources across the map which will require trading between players to access the scarce resources of each players civilisation. Each hex tile produces an attached resource except for the barren dessert. Hills produce brick, forests produce lumber, mountains produce ore, fields produce grain, and pastures produce wool. 

The aim of this tabletop companion is to provide a helpful guide to new and old players. Allow for game hosting to keep track of resources without needing all the cards from the game which may be missing.
