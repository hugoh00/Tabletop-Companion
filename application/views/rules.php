                <p>
                Catan has a modular board, meaning it can be put together in several different variations, you could use the link we have provided to randomize your board if you are a more seasoned player. For your first game, however, there is a recommended way to set up your board witch you could find on the Catan rule book. Follow the instructions below to assemble your board.
                </p>
                <li>1.	Put together the frame by clipping together the blue edges of the board.</li>
                <li>2.	Stack the land hex tiles in a beginner’s formation or starting from a corner and working counter clockwise until all the tiles are stacked for a variable setup. </li>
                <li>3.	Start placing the numbered circles in the hex tiles either as shown in the beginners set up. Or you could stack it counter clockwise working your way to the middle.</li>
                <li>4.	The robber pawn always starts at the desert.</li>
            </div>
            <div class="container rounded col-sm px-2 m-2" style="border:1px solid black">
            <p>
            <li>Chose a player colour. Take five settlements, four cities and 15 roads of your colour. And place them in front of you.</li>
            <li>Place two settlements and two roads  on the board if you’re a new player follow the guide on where to place your settlement on the Catan rule book. The experienced players can chose where to place their first settlements themselves by taking turns to place their settlement and a road. The last person to roll the dice places their settlement first so it goes from last to first.</li>
            <li>Building costs could be viewed on our main page. And you can also keep track of your resources and all your victory points.</li>
            <li>The Longest Road and Largest Army cards should be placed alongside the game board. You can use our dice roller and victory point chart to see who is in the lead. Those futures are located in the game page. </li>
            <li>Track all the resources you get by inputting the number of resources you get in the resource chart every round.</li>
            <li>For the recommended beginner setup, you take the resources of the land surrounding the settlement marked by the white star in the rulebook: Yellow receives a sheep, a wood and a wheat. Red gets a wheat, a wood and a sheep. Blue gets a brick, a sheep and an ore. White gets an ore, a wood and a sheep.</li>
            <li>When using the experienced player setup, you instead receive resources from each of the tiles next to your second settlement.</li>

                <h4 class="text-center">Resource Production </h4>
                <li>Roll the dice at the start of your turn. The result of the dice effects everyone so if your settlement is on the corner of that hex tile you should collect the allocated resource and add it to add it to your dynamic table. Every time a number gets rolled if you have a settlement in the corner you will get one resource every round unless the thief is on that tile which stops you from taking that resource.</li>
                <li>Every player needs to make sure they keep track of their own settlements and whether or not they receive a resource on any given roll. And input the reaccuses they receive on the chart.</li>
                <li>Catan is a game of probability to a certain extent, as the resources that come up will be determined by the dice that get rolled. 7 is the most likely number to be rolled with two dice and is treated slightly differently...</li>
                <li>If you roll a 7 on your turn in Catan, you activate the robber.</li>
                <li>Any player that has more than seven resource cards in their hand must return half of them (rounded down) to the resource stacks. That includes the person who activated the robber. So update your chart if you have more then 7 cards.</li>
                <li>You now get to move the robber onto one of the numbers on the board, covering up that number - stopping players from gaining resources from adjacent settlements if that number is rolled - until the robber is moved again.</li>
                <li>As they are a robber, you also get to steal a resource at random from a player with a settlement next to the number you cover. If the robber affects more than one player, choose one to take a resource from</li>

            <h4 class="text-center">Building</h4>
                <p>
                    End of each player’s turn is the building phase of the game
                    As long as you have the building materials, so check your chart and see if you want to build anything and use the dynamic table to build 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Roads
                    <li>Building roads costs one brick and one wood. Roads are placed on the edges of hexes and will allow you to build settlements further afield, giving you an opportunity to gain more resources.</li>
                    <li>The first player to build a road at least five sections long (in a single stretch - not including forks) receives the Longest Road card, which is worth two victory points at the end of the game.</li>
                    <li>If another player exceeds the length of that person’s road, they get to take that card from them - so the Longest Road card is never entirely safe in any one player’s possession. </li>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Settlements
                    <li>Building settlements requires a brick, a wood, a sheep and a wheat. Getting settlements on the board quickly can be quite an important strategy in the game, as each settlement is worth one victory point. You need 10 victory points to win the game.</li>
                    <li>You can only ever place a settlement somewhere that is connected by your roads and you need to be at least two spaces away from another settlement, including your own. That means no settlement can be adjacent to another settlement.<li>
                    <li>As well as giving you a precious victory point, each settlement rewards you with resources whenever one of the numbers next to it is rolled.</li>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Cities
                    <li>Building a city requires three ore and two wheat, you can only build it if you’ve already got an existing settlement. </li>
                    <li>You can only build a city if you have a settlement on the board that can be replaced with the new city. Cities will earn you double the resources and are worth two victory points each. </li>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Development Cards
                    <li>Buying development cards is also part of the building phase and costs one sheep, one ore and one wheat. They could be a game changer however it’s based on a lucky draw</li>
                    <li>Development cards are kept hidden until a certain point when player decides to use them. A development card cannot be used on the same turn when you bought them.</li>
                    <li>All instructions are written on the cards. There are three types of development cards: knights, progress cards and victory points cards.</li>
                    <li>Knights are similar to the Longest Road card in that the first player to play three knights in front of them will receive a two-point bonus victory points for having the Largest Army. But, just like the Longest Road, this card can be stolen by another player if their army is larger than yours. Knights also activate the robber when played, in which case you behave as if you had just rolled a 7.</li>
                    <li>Progress cards vary and what they do is laid out very clearly on each card. They usually give you resources or allow you to build without spending resources. Once played, the card is removed from the game.</li>
                    <li>Victory point cards are the best development cards you can acquire. Keep them hidden if you want to win with a surprise victory. But beware as they could be stolen.</li>

                <p>
                    There are two types of trading in Catan: domestic and maritime.
                    <br>
                    Domestic:
                    <li>Domestic trading is trading between you and other players. You can announce what you’re after and what you’d be willing to trade for it. The other players can make counter offers and proposals to you but not to each other on your turn.</li>
                    Maritime:
                    <li>Maritime trading allows you to trade four of one good for one of another. You can perform this action this no matter what, but if you have a settlement or city on a harbour, you get a rebate of some kind based on the token - such as being able to trade at 3:1 or sometimes even 2:1 for a specific resource.

                    Victory in Catan is simple you just need 10 Victory points
                    They can be acquired by various things
                    <li>Settlement - 1 Victory Point</li>
                    <li>City - 2 Victory Point</li>
                    <li>Largest Army - 2 Victory Point</li>

                    Catan uses the same rules as catan in addition to some new rules these rules include.

                    <h4 class="text-center">Setting the Game up</h4>
                    
                    <li>Assemble the frame pieces by fixing them together from all sides.</li>
                    <li>After you assembled the frames put the hexes inside the frame and use the booklet to assemble the hex tiles and chose a preferred scenario setting.</li>
                    <li>After you have built the board randomly place the harbour tokens listed in the scenario description.</li>

                    <h4 class="text-center">Ship Building</h4>
                    <li>In order to travel from one island to another you will need to build ships. Ships function in a similar manner to roads they are placed on the sides of the hex tiles to create ship routes</li>
                    <li>To build ships you need 1 wool and 1 lumber.</li>
                    <li>Unlike roads ships can only be placed in the ocean and cannot be placed between two hex tiles.</li>
                    <li>You cannot build a ship on a coast if there is already a road on that side.</li>
                    <li>You can place ships alongside settlements or cities.</li>
                    <li>Or you may place a ship alongside your other ships to form a ship route.</li>
                    <li>Once a ship route is connected to two settlements they cannot be moved, before that point you have the chance to move a single ship every turn before its connected on a route</li>
                    <li>Ships are to connect the main land to other islands forming ship routes. This is the only way to get to the rich resources that are residing on the scattered islands.</li>
                    <li>Building the longest trade route will reward you with 2 victory pints its similar to having the longest road which also gives you two victory points.</li>

                    <li>In some of the scenarios the chits are tradeable for victory points so its essential to control the tiles that produce the chits. </li>
                    <li>The road building development card is a new addition to the base game which lets you place two roads as if you just built them. </li>
                    <li>Gold fields is a new addition to the hex tiles which produces gold which ultimately means it could produce any resource of your choosing if the number is rolled. They are usually scattered in the islands on the board depending on what scenario you chose to play in. Establishing good shipping routes to get to this resource could be game changing.</li>
                    <li>In the beginning of the game, you have the option your place your settlements along the shore to build two ships instead of two roads.</li>

                    <li>The pirate serves a similar purpose to the robber every time a player rolls a 7 they can either move the pirate or the thief. </li>
                    <li>The pirate could block trade routed and stop them from completion which will hinder other civilisations progress. </li>
                    <li>You could also activate the pirate after using your knight development card.</li>
                    <li>And if a pirate is blocking a route, you may not move your unconnected ships until the pirate ship is moved elsewhere.</li>

                    <li>Divide the progress cards into 3 stacks by the flag color on the back of each card
                        (green, blue, and yellow). Shuffle each stack separately and place them face down near the island.
                    </li>
                    <li>Place the 3 metropolises, the trader cone, the 3 dice 
                        (1 yellow, 1 red, and 1 event die), and the "Longest Road" card near the island.
                    </li>
                    <li>Place the black wooden ship on the "barbarian ship" space on the Barbarian Tile.
                        The barbarian ship moves along this track on its way to Catan.
                    </li>
                    <li>Place the robber on the desert hex.
                    </li>
                    <li>Each player selects a color and takes all of the pieces of that color. 
                        Each player receives:
                        -5 settlements, 4 cities, and 15 roads (all from the Catan base game);
                        -6 knights (2 each of basic, strong, and mighty knights);
                        -3 city walls; and
                        -1 development flip-chart.
                    </li>
                    <br>

                    <p>
                        Set-Up phase

                    <li>Once you've constructed the board and arranged the pieces, begin the set-up phase. 
                        Now the players place their initial settlements, cities, and roads. 
                        Each player rolls the dice; the player with the highest roll begins.
                    </li>
                    <li>Starting with the first player and continuing clockwise around the table, 
                            each player places 1 settlement and 1 road (as in basic Catan).
                    </li>
                    <li>Then, the second placement round begins with the last player to place a settlement. 
                        It continues counterclockwise around the table (so the first player to place a settlement will be the last to place). 
                        Each player now places 1 city and 1 road, following all of the normal rules for placement described in the Catan base game
                        (i.e., no city may be placed fewer than 2 spaces away from all settlements, etc).
                    </li>
                    <li>You receive your first resources immediately after you place your city. 
                        You get 1 resource for each terrain that your city is adjacent to. 
                    </li>
                    <li>Place your development flipchart in front of you with the first page showing 
                        (indicating that you have not built any city improvements).

                    <p>
                        The player who placed the last city takes the first turn; afterwards, in clockwise direction, 
                        one by one the other players take their turns. On your turn, the following actions are performed, 
                        in the order listed:
                    <li>1. You roll all 3 dice.</li>
                    <li>2. The results of the event (symbol) die are resolved.</li>
                    <li>3. Progress cards may be drawn (depending on the result of the event die).</li>
                    <li>4. All players produce the resources indicated by the red and yellow dice.</li>
                    <li>5. All players produce the commodities indicated by the red and yellow dice.</li>
                    <li>6. You may do any or all of the following in any order:
                        -Trade resources and/or commodities with the bank and/or other players.
                        -Build roads, settlements, cities, knights, city walls, and/or city improvements.
                        -Activate, promote, and/or perform actions with your knights.
                        -Play any number of progress cards.

                    <h4 class="text-center">Specific Actions</h4>
                    <p>
                        Dice rolls
                    </p>
                    <p>Each player begins his turn by rolling all 3 of the dice. 
                        The result of the dice will determine not only which terrain hexes produce resources and commodities,
                        but also what actions the barbarians will take, and if any progress cards are drawn. 
                         The effects of the die roll must be resolved in a specific order:
                    <li>1. First, use the event die to determine what event takes place that turn.
                    </li>
                    <li>2. If the ship symbol is showing, then move the barbarian ship 1 space closer to the island of Catan. 
                        The ship follows the track on the Barbarian Tile. The ship begins its journey on the space illustrated with the ship. 
                        The barbarians attack when the ship reaches the last space.</li>
                    <li>3. If one of the three city gate symbols (blue, green, or yellow) is showing, then all players may be eligible to draw a progress card. 
                        To be eligible, a player must be able to match the number rolled on the red die with one of the red die icons showing on his flip-chart 
                        in the section that matches the color of the city gate rolled on the symbol die.Beginning with the player whose turn it is, and continuing clockwise, 
                        each eligible player draws the topmost card from the progress card stack that matches the color of the city gate showing on the event die.
                        Keep your progress cards secret from your opponents until you play them. You may never have more than 4 progress cards in your hand.</li>
                    <li>4. Add the red and the yellow dice together to determine which hexes produce resources and commodities for all players. 
                        All hexes whose number matches this sum produces 1 of the appropriate resources for each settlement adjacent to it. 
                        Production for a city bordering a producing hex depends on the type of terrain rolled.</li>
                    <li>As in Catan base game, any hex that is occupied by the robber does not produce any resources or commodities.
                        Also, if a "7" is rolled on the dice, no hexes produce: instead, the player who rolled the "7" must move the robber and may be able to steal
                        1 card from any opponent whose settlement or city is adjacent to the robber. The robber cannot be moved until after the barbarians reach the island of Catan for the first time.
                        Until the first barbarian attack, if you roll a "7", each player must check if he is holding too many cards as usual; 
                        however, you do not move the robber from the desert and you do not steal a card from another player. 
                        Further, you are not allowed to move the robber by playing of any progress cards (like the Bishop) or knight actions until after the first barbarian attack.</li>

                        <h4 class="text-center">Trading & Building</h4>
                        <p> 
                            In Cities & Knights, you are allowed to build and trade any number of times and in any order. 
                            You do not need to finish all of your trading before you begin your building.
                            All of the rules from Catan apply to trades made in Cities & Knights (with the addition of the commodity cards). 
                            Progress cards may never be traded at any time. All of the basic rules for building remain in effect. 
                            The cost of roads, settlements, and cities remain unchanged. There are, however, 2 new items that you may elect to build during your turn. 
                            Also, you may no longer purchase development cards with resources. The 2 new items are city walls and knights.
                        </p>
                        </div>

                    <div class="row">

                    <h4 class="text-center">City Walls</h4>
                    <p>
                        To build a city wall, you must pay two brick resources to the bank. Place the city wall (the square wooden piece) under any city you own on the board. 
                        There are three restrictions on the placement of city walls:
                    <li>1. You may only build city walls under cities-never under settlements.</li>
                    <li>2. You may only build one city wall under each city.</li>
                    <li>3. You may never have more than 3 city walls at one time. </li>
                    
                    Each city wall you control increases the maximum number of cards you safely hold in your hand when a "7" is rolled on the production dice. Each city wall adds 2 cards to this limit.
                    Example: If you have 2 cities, each with a city wall, you may safely hold up to 11 cards in your hand without having to discard half of them when a "7" is rolled.
                    If the barbarians pillage your city (i.e., reduce it to a settlement), the city wall is also destroyed. You must remove the city wall from the board.

                        <h4 class="text-center">Knights</h4>
                        <p>Knights are represented by the round wooden tokens. Each knight token is labeled on both sides. One side-showing the symbol of a knight's helmet in black and white-is the inactive side.
                        An inactive knight may not perform any actions. The other side of the token, which depicts the helmet in color, is the active side. 
                        The type of helmet and the number of rings indicate the strength of the knight. If you wish to "hire" a knight, you must pay one wool and one ore to the bank. 
                        This allows you to take a basic knight (open helmet/one ring) and place it on the board. Newly placed knights are always placed with the inactive side up.
                        You may place your knight on any unoccupied intersection connected to your roads.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are 2 special purchases you can make once you have a knight:

                        <p>Activating a Knight

                            In order for a knight to take an action, he must first be activated. To activate a knight, you must pay one grain to the bank.
                            Then you may turn the knight token over to the active side, which depicts the helmet in color.
                            The strength of the knight does not affect the cost to activate it. It costs only one grain, regardless of whether it is a basic knight, or a mighty knight.
                            A knight may be activated on the same turn he was built; however, the knight may not perform an action on that same turn.</p>
                        
                        <p>Promoting a Knight

                            You can increase the strength and effectiveness of your knights by paying additional commodities. 
                            The cost to promote a basic knight to a strong knight or a strong knight to a mighty knight is one wool and one ore.
                            When you promote a knight, return the old knight token (which may be repurchased later) and replace it with a token showing the next higher strength level. 
                            The new, stronger knight must be placed in the same location as the knight you have promoted.
                            The status of the knight, active or inactive, is not changed when you promote the knight. 
                            You may promote a knight on the same turn that he was originally built, or on any later turn. A knight may only be promoted once per turn. 
                            You may only promote a strong knight to a mighty knight after you have purchased the third level of the politics (blue) city improvement (the "Fortress").</p>

                        <h4 class="text-center">Commodities</h4>
                        <p>
                            In Cities & Knights, we've added 3 new, "refined" materials to the game. As in Catan, we refer to the 5 basic materials (lumber, wool, grain, brick, and ore) as "resources".
                            The 3 new materials (cloth, coin, and paper) are called "commodities". In many ways, the commodities are treated the same as resources, but there are also some ways in which they differ.
                        <li>Commodities are produced only by cities, and only in forest, pasture, and mountains.</li>
                        <li>Commodities, when produced, are added to your hand of resource cards. They count toward the robber or limit when a "7" is rolled. They may be stolen by the robber, or lost as a discard.</li>
                        <li>The borders on commodity cards are intertwined with ribbons that match the color of the commodity (gold for cloth, green for paper, and gray for coin). The borders on the resource cards all are plain knot work. 
                            Both commodity cards and resource cards have the same card backs (i.e., a map).
                            Commodities may be traded in all the same ways as resources. You may trade them freely with other players. You may exchange 4 of the same commodity for 1 of any resource or commodity you choose.
                            If you have a settlement or a city on a 3:1 harbor, you may trade 3 of any commodity for 1 of any resource or commodity of your choice. 
                            You may also trade 4 of any resource for 1 of any commodity you choose (3:1 at a harbor; 2:1 if you have the matching special harbor).</li>
                        <li>You need commodities to acquire city improvements.</li>
                        <li>Some progress cards specifically mention "resources" or "commodities". These cards can only affect the type of material they specifically mention.</li>

                    <h4 class="text-center">City Improvements</h4>
                    <p> 
                        One of your most important considerations as a prince of Catan is the continued improvement of your cities. This improvement is made possible through the use of commodity cards. You are able to improve your cities in three areas of development: trade (yellow); politics (blue); and science (green). You may purchase improvements in all 3 areas even if you own only 1 city. Your city improvements are tracked with your development flip-chart. 
                        Your flip-chart is divided into 3 separate parts, 1 for each of the 3 areas of development. Each section has 5 pages, which correspond to the 5 levels of improvement you can acquire in each area. At the beginning of the game, open page 1 of your flip-chart; the page indicates that you have no improvements.
                        The various improvements are represented by important buildings that can be constructed in your cities, such as a market, a cathedral, or a library. The cost of a building is shown in the lower right corner of each flip-chart page.
                        Example: The market costs 1 cloth. Pay 1 cloth and flip the Market section of your development flip-chart.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                    <p> The first improvement in each area always costs 1 commodity of the matching type. The second improvement in each area costs 2 of that commodity. The cost of each subsequent improvement is again increased by 1.
                        There is one restriction on the purchase of improvements, however. If you have no cities on the board (because the barbarians have pillaged your last city), you may not purchase any city improvements until you have built at least 1 city.
                        Each improvement increases your chance of being eligible to draw progress cards. Each improvement shows a picture of the improvement. Above that picture is a row of red dice.
                        Each die shows a number. If the event die roll shows a city gate, you may draw a progress card of like color-but only if the number on the red die matches one of the dice pictured on that color's section on your development flip-chart. A higher level of improvement increases your chance to draw progress cards.
                        Example: If you have built the market improvement, it shows 2 red dice. If the event die rolls the yellow city gate, and the red die shows a "1" or "2", then you may draw a yellow progress card.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                    <p> In addition, when you build the third improvement in each area, you receive a special ability. You are able to use this ability for the remainder of the game, even if other players also achieve the third level of improvement (in which case they also get the advantage) or if you purchase improvements beyond the third level. 
                        The advantage that you gain from each color of improvement is different:
                    <li>Trading House (yellow): You may trade commodities (of the same type) 2:1 for any commodity or resource.
                        You may make this trade only during your turn, as if you were using a harbor.
                        This special trade advantage does not include resources, only the three commodities.</li>
                    <li>Fortress (blue): You may promote strong knights to mighty knights after you have built the fortress.
                        You must still pay to promote the knights normally.</li>
                    <li>Aqueduct (green): If, when the dice are rolled for production, you do not receive any resources or commodities, you may take any one resource of your choice from the bank. You many not, however, use this ability when a "7" is rolled.</li>

                    <h4 class="text-center">The Metropolis</h4>
                     <p> 
                            Building city improvements is also important if you want to have a metropolis. A metropolis is represented by a yellow city gate. These gates are designed to fit over the wooden city pieces.
                            Only 3 metropolises may be in play at any given time: one each for trade, politics, and science.
                        <li>The first player who achieves the fourth level of improvement in any one of these 3 areas (the bank, the cathedral, or the theater) may place one of the metropolis gates on any one of his cities on the board.
                            You may take the metropolis only if no other player already controls the fourth level improvement of that color, for there can be only 1 metropolis for science, trade, or politics. When you acquire a metropolis, 
                            place the metropolis token of the appropriate color on your flip-chart to show which area is associated with your metropolis.</li>
                        <li>A city with a metropolis is worth a total of 4 victory points! This includes 2 points for the city and 2 additional points for the metropolis.</li>
                        <li>You may take another player's metropolis if you are able to acquire the fifth level of improvement in the matching color before he does. 
                            If another player reaches the fifth level of improvement before the metropolis owner does, he may take both the metropolis piece and the colored metropolis token. If you have reached the fifth level of improvement in any area, no player may take your metropolis away.
                            A metropolis is immune to the barbarians. It can never be pillaged or reduced. However, the metropolis is counted when determining the strength of the barbarian army.</li>
                        <li>You may build more than one metropolis. If you are the first player to reach the fourth level of improvement in more than one area (or if you reach the fifth level, thereby taking another player's metropolis away), you may place another metropolis gate on one of your cities.</li>
                        <li>But, you may not purchase any improvements beyond the third level of a given color unless you have a city where you could build a metropolis. If you do not have such a city on the board, you must wait until you have built at least one more city.</li>

                    <h4 class="text-center">Progress Cards</h4>
                        <p>
                            In Cities & Knights, progress cards replace the development cards from the Catan base game. You don't purchase progress cards like development cards; 
                            instead you draw them with the right combination of event die and red die.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To be able to draw a progress card:

                        <li>You must possess at least one level of city improvement in one or more areas of development. The first level of improvement displays two red dice, the second level displays three, and so on.</li>

                        <li>The event die, when rolled on any player's turn, must show the city gate symbol whose color matches the color of one of your city improvements.</li>

                        <li>The number on the red die, rolled at the same time, must match one of the red dice displayed on your city improvement whose color matches the city gate on the symbol die.</li>
                        </p>

                        <p> If these three conditions are met, you may draw the top card from the progress card stack that matches the color of the city gate on the event die. 
                            If more than one player is allowed to draw on the same turn, then each player draws in turn order, beginning with the player whose turn it is.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p> Example: Player A rolls a "6" on the white die, a "3" on the red die, and the yellow city gate on the event die. 
                            Player B has already built a town hall (blue) and a merchant guild (yellow).
                            Since player B's yellow improvement shows a red die with "3", showing player B may draw a yellow progress card.
                        </p>
                        <p> During your turn, you may play as many progress cards as you wish. All progress cards may only be played after you roll the dice (exception: the "Alchemist"). 
                        Here are some specific rules about the play of progress cards:
                        <li>Victory point cards must be played immediately when drawn. The Spy may not steal them, and they cannot be hidden in your hand.
                            These cards do not count toward your hand limit of 4 cards.</li>

                        <li>You may never hold more than four progress cards in your hand. If you draw a fifth progress card, and you cannot play it because it is not your turn, 
                            you must discard one card (of your choice) to the bottom of the appropriate stack.</li>

                        <li>Progress cards may be played on the same turn they are drawn.</li>

                        <li>Progress cards may not be traded with other players, nor may the robber steal them.</li>

                        <li>When you play a progress card, place it face down under the appropriate progress card stack.
                            Victory points, however, remain face-up and in play.</li>

                    <h4 class="text-center">Attack Of The Barbarians</h4>
                        <p> 
                            Catan is in constant danger of attack from the barbarians that live across the sea. Each turn the event die shows a black ship, the barbarian navy moves one space closer towards Catan. 
                            When the ship reaches the red-circled space that depicts barbarians landing on the shore, the barbarians attack Catan. 
                            
                            When the barbarians attack, follow these steps:

                        1.  Determine The Barbarians' Strength.

                        <li>The strength of the barbarians is equal to the number of cities (including metropolises) owned by all players. 
                            Add up all of the cities owned by all of the players anywhere on the island to determine this strength.</li>

                        2.  Determine The Strength Of Catan's Knights.
                        
                        <li>All active knights of all players (even those who do not own any cities) will defend against the barbarians. 
                            Only the active knights are counted, the inactive knights do not assist in defending the island in any way.

                            Remember that the strength of each knight is based upon its type: basic (1), strong (2), or mighty (3). 
                            Sum up the value of all the active knights to determine the strength of the defending army.</li>

                        3.  Compare Attackers' And Defenders' Strengths.
                            There are 2 possible outcomes of this battle:

                        <li>If the barbarians are stronger, they are victorious! If the barbarians win the battle, they pillage one or more cities.

                            Pillaged cities are reduced to settlements (replace the city piece with a settlement). 
                            The barbarians pillage one city belonging to the player who had the lowest total strength of active knights when the barbarians attacked.
                            
                            Any player who contributed no knights are automatically considered to have the lowest total strength of active knights. 
                            If various players tie for having the lowest total strength of active knights, each of those players loses 1 of his cities.
                            
                            If the barbarians pillage a city that has a city wall, the city wall is destroyed and removed from the board.
                            
                            Example: Players A and B each have two cities. Player C has only a metropolis, and player D has only settlements. The barbarians attack, and their strength is 5 (i.e., 4 cities plus 1 metropolis).
                            
                            Players A, B, and D each have one simple knight activated, and player C has no active knights. 
                            Therefore, the knights defend with a strength of 3. Since the knights are weaker, the barbarians win and Catan loses. Because of the loss, players A and B each lose one of their cities.
                            
                            Player C cannot lose anything because he has only a metropolis. Similarly, player D has no cities to lose. 
                            Even though C contributed fewer knights than all the other players, since he is immune to the attack it is the next smallest contributor who thus suffers the effects of the barbarians.</li>
                        
                        <li>If the knights have a strength equal to or greater than the barbarians, the knights win and Catan is saved! The player with the highest total strength of active knights (this will not always be the greatest number of knights) will be declared the "Defender of Catan"!
                            
                            As a reward, he is presented with one of the 6 "Defender of Catan" victory point (VP) cards.
                            
                            Each VP card is worth 1 VP and is placed face-up in front of the player. If 2 or more players tie for the highest total strength of knights, no player is declared Defender of Catan, and no one receives a VP card.
                            
                            Instead, each of the players who tie for the highest strength draws the top card from any 1 of the 3 progress card stacks (his choice). In clockwise order, each eligible player selects 1 card, starting with the player whose turn it is.</li>

                                All knights on the board are turned so that their inactive (black &white) side faces up.

                                Note, however, that you may not build any additional city improvements until you have built at least one city. Once you own a city again, you may continue to purchase city improvements normally.

                            <p> The merchant piece (the cone) is put into play whenever any player uses one of the "Merchant" progress cards (from the yellow stack).

                                If you play one of these cards, you may place the merchant piece on any land hex adjacent to one of your cities or settlements. 
                                Until another merchant card is played, you may trade the resource (not commodity) that is produced in that land hex at a 2:1 rate.

                                All of the normal rules for trading at a 2:1 harbor are in effect for these trades.
                                
                                Note: In addition, as long as you retain control of the merchant, you receive 1 victory point!
                                
                                If another merchant card is played, whoever played that card (it could be you) takes control of the merchant. 
                                He may move the Merchant to any hex adjacent to one of his settlements or cities. He receives the trade benefit, and he gets the bonus victory point.

                        <li>1. Barbarians land in Catan (each time you build a settlement or upgrade to a city)</li>
                        <li>2. Immediately play a development card (each time you buy a development card)</li>
                        <li>3. Place a knight (each time you play a "Knighthood" or a "Swift Knight" development card)</li>
                        <li>4. Move your knights (at the end of your turn, after you finish trading and building)</li>

                    <br>
                    <p>
                        1. Barbarian Attack:
                        (Proceed as follows)
                        <li>Roll the dice until you get a result that is not a "7" (re-roll as many times)
                            Then place a barbarian on the coastal hex with the number token of the dice roll result.
                            If this coastal hex already has 3 barbarians, do not place a barbarian or re-roll the dice.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Roll the dice until you get a result that is not "7" and is not the same as the first result.
                            Then use this dice result to place a barbarian as outlined above.
                        </li>
                        <li>Roll the dice until you get a result that is not "7" and is not the same as either
                            of the first two dice roll results. Then use this dice roll result to place a barbarian as outlined in the 1st procedure.
                        </li>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2. Coastal hex is conquered
                        <li>3 barbarians on a coastal hex means the token should be faced down</li>
                        <li>It no longer produces resources when you roll its number. You no longer place barbarins on this hex during an attack</li>
                        <li>You may not build a road on a path adjacent to a conquered hex</li>
                        <li>You may not build a settlement on an intersection adjeacent to conquered hex</li>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        3. A settlement or city is conquered
                        <li>As soon as a city is not adjacent to an unconquered hex. It is conquered</li>
                        <li>You get no victory points for a conquered settlement/city</li>
                        <li>If a conquered settlement/city has a harbour, you cannot use it</li>
                        <li>Since the desert hex and castle hex can never be conquered, a settlement or city adjacent to one of these cannot be conquered</li>

                        </li>
                        <li>Do not place number tokens on the 3 trade hexes - remove the "2" and "12" number tokens from play.

                            each stack and place it with the backs facing up (showing the picture of a building) beside the corresponding
                            trade hex.
                        </li>
                        <li>You recieve the set of 5 baggage train cards whose frame colours match your colour, stacking face down and sorted in the sequence of 1-5. Turn the top baggage train card of your
                            stack face up and place it next to the stack. This is your active baggage train card.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Place the 3 barbarians on the paths marked with black crosses</li>

                        Trade Hexes:
                        <li>Each of the 3 trade hexes has a "central plaza" intersection with a building.
                            Four "interior" paths lead to this central plaza.
                        </li>
                        <li>You may build roads on interior paths, according to usual rules</li>

                        These apply after finishing up trading and building during your turn
                        <li>You move along paths from intersection to adjacent intersection. This costs 1 or more "movement points" (MPs)</li>
                        <li>Any number of wagons may occupy a given intersection</li>
                        <li>At the beginning of the game, your wagon has 4 MPs to use each time your take your turn. You can increase MPs by upgrading your train</li>
                        <li>The MP cost = 2 if the path does NOT have a road</li>
                        <li>The MP cost = 1 if the path has one of YOUR own roads</li>

                        <li>Ships are moved along sea routes. The edges of a sea hex are called sea
                            routes. Sea routes separate sea hexes from each other and terrain hexes from sea hexes
                            . The edges of frame pieces bordering sea hexes or terrain hexes are also considered as sea routes.

                        <li>Building ships: A ship costs 1 lumber and 1 wool to build. When built, place on a sea route directly adjacent to
                            one of your harbour settlements, with the following conditions:
                            You cannot place a ship on a sea route adjacent to an undiscovered hex. 
                            If you want to build a new ship when all your ships are already on the game board, you may
                            remove any 1 of your ships from the game board and build a new ship. (Any pieces in the hold of a ship are lost and returned to your supply).

                        <li>You must complete the movement of one ship before you can move your next ship</li>
                        <li>During your turn, you may buy 2 additional movement points for a ship by spending 1 wool card
                            This may be done once (and only once) for each ship, each turn.
                        </li>
                        <li>Up to 2 ships may occupy a given sea route</li>
                        <li>You may move your ship past another ship. However, the movement of your ship
                            may not end on a sea route that is already occupied by 2 ships.

                        <li>If after moving a ship, one of its ends (bow or stern) points towards the corner of an undiscovered hex, you must discover that hex</li>
                        <li>Turn the hex over, if its a terrain hex, take a number token from the matching colour/icon and place number side up on the hex.</li>
                        <li>If you discover a terrain hex, you are rewarded 1 resource of the type produced by that hex. If you discover any other type of hex, you get 2 gold.</li>
                        <li>After discovering, you are not allowed to move the ship any further. Any remaining MP are forfeited</li>

                        <li>For 2 grain and 2 ore, you can upgrade any one of your coastal settlements
                            to build a harbour settlement. Pay the building costs, return the settlement to your supply
                            and replace it with a harbour settlement.
                        </li>
                        <li>A harbour settlement is worth 2 victory points</li>

                        <li>When you build a settler, you must place it either into the empty basin of one of your harbour settlements or directly
                            into the empty hold of one of your ships. Which must be located on a sea route adjacent to one of your harbour settlements
                        </li>
                        <li>A ship with a settler in its hold is called a settler ship</li>
                        <li>If the spaces in the habour basin and in an adjacent ship's hold are occupied by another game piece
                            , you can build the settler only if you remove the other game piece from the basin or hold and return it to your supply.

                        You win this scenario if you reach 8 victory points on your turn. Overall, this is an expansion that requires careful planning in both movement
                        and resource tracking. The beauty of this expansion of Explorers and Pirates is that each scenario can be used with other scenarios to further enhance
                        gameplay. For instance, involving scenario 2 of adding pirates and pirate lairs. All of which can be found in the Explorers & Pirates book!
