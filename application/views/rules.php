                <p>
                Catan has a modular board, meaning it can be put together in several different variations, you could use the link we have provided to randomize your board if you are a more seasoned player. For your first game, however, there is a recommended way to set up your board witch you could find on the Catan rule book. Follow the instructions below to assemble your board.
                </p>
                <li>1.	Put together the frame by clipping together the blue edges of the board.</li>
                <li>2.	Stack the land hex tiles in a beginner’s formation or starting from a corner and working counter clockwise until all the tiles are stacked for a variable setup. </li>
                <li>3.	Start placing the numbered circles in the hex tiles either as shown in the beginners set up. Or you could stack it counter clockwise working your way to the middle.</li>
                <li>4.	The robber pawn always starts at the desert.</li>
            </div>
            <div class="container rounded col-sm px-2 m-2" style="border:1px solid black">
            <p>
            <li>Chose a player colour. Take five settlements, four cities and 15 roads of your colour. And place them in front of you.</li>
            <li>Place two settlements and two roads  on the board if you’re a new player follow the guide on where to place your settlement on the Catan rule book. The experienced players can chose where to place their first settlements themselves by taking turns to place their settlement and a road. The last person to roll the dice places their settlement first so it goes from last to first.</li>
            <li>Building costs could be viewed on our main page. And you can also keep track of your resources and all your victory points.</li>
            <li>The Longest Road and Largest Army cards should be placed alongside the game board. You can use our dice roller and victory point chart to see who is in the lead. Those futures are located in the game page. </li>
            <li>Track all the resources you get by inputting the number of resources you get in the resource chart every round.</li>
            <li>For the recommended beginner setup, you take the resources of the land surrounding the settlement marked by the white star in the rulebook: Yellow receives a sheep, a wood and a wheat. Red gets a wheat, a wood and a sheep. Blue gets a brick, a sheep and an ore. White gets an ore, a wood and a sheep.</li>
            <li>When using the experienced player setup, you instead receive resources from each of the tiles next to your second settlement.</li>

                <h4 class="text-center">Resource Production </h4>
                <li>Roll the dice at the start of your turn. The result of the dice effects everyone so if your settlement is on the corner of that hex tile you should collect the allocated resource and add it to add it to your dynamic table. Every time a number gets rolled if you have a settlement in the corner you will get one resource every round unless the thief is on that tile which stops you from taking that resource.</li>
                <li>Every player needs to make sure they keep track of their own settlements and whether or not they receive a resource on any given roll. And input the reaccuses they receive on the chart.</li>
                <li>Catan is a game of probability to a certain extent, as the resources that come up will be determined by the dice that get rolled. 7 is the most likely number to be rolled with two dice and is treated slightly differently...</li>
                <li>If you roll a 7 on your turn in Catan, you activate the robber.</li>
                <li>Any player that has more than seven resource cards in their hand must return half of them (rounded down) to the resource stacks. That includes the person who activated the robber. So update your chart if you have more then 7 cards.</li>
                <li>You now get to move the robber onto one of the numbers on the board, covering up that number - stopping players from gaining resources from adjacent settlements if that number is rolled - until the robber is moved again.</li>
                <li>As they are a robber, you also get to steal a resource at random from a player with a settlement next to the number you cover. If the robber affects more than one player, choose one to take a resource from</li>

            <h4 class="text-center">Building</h4>
                <p>
                    End of each player’s turn is the building phase of the game
                    As long as you have the building materials, so check your chart and see if you want to build anything and use the dynamic table to build 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Roads
                    <li>Building roads costs one brick and one wood. Roads are placed on the edges of hexes and will allow you to build settlements further afield, giving you an opportunity to gain more resources.</li>
                    <li>The first player to build a road at least five sections long (in a single stretch - not including forks) receives the Longest Road card, which is worth two victory points at the end of the game.</li>
                    <li>If another player exceeds the length of that person’s road, they get to take that card from them - so the Longest Road card is never entirely safe in any one player’s possession. </li>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Settlements
                    <li>Building settlements requires a brick, a wood, a sheep and a wheat. Getting settlements on the board quickly can be quite an important strategy in the game, as each settlement is worth one victory point. You need 10 victory points to win the game.</li>
                    <li>You can only ever place a settlement somewhere that is connected by your roads and you need to be at least two spaces away from another settlement, including your own. That means no settlement can be adjacent to another settlement.<li>
                    <li>As well as giving you a precious victory point, each settlement rewards you with resources whenever one of the numbers next to it is rolled.</li>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Cities
                    <li>Building a city requires three ore and two wheat, you can only build it if you’ve already got an existing settlement. </li>
                    <li>You can only build a city if you have a settlement on the board that can be replaced with the new city. Cities will earn you double the resources and are worth two victory points each. </li>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Development Cards
                    <li>Buying development cards is also part of the building phase and costs one sheep, one ore and one wheat. They could be a game changer however it’s based on a lucky draw</li>
                    <li>Development cards are kept hidden until a certain point when player decides to use them. A development card cannot be used on the same turn when you bought them.</li>
                    <li>All instructions are written on the cards. There are three types of development cards: knights, progress cards and victory points cards.</li>
                    <li>Knights are similar to the Longest Road card in that the first player to play three knights in front of them will receive a two-point bonus victory points for having the Largest Army. But, just like the Longest Road, this card can be stolen by another player if their army is larger than yours. Knights also activate the robber when played, in which case you behave as if you had just rolled a 7.</li>
                    <li>Progress cards vary and what they do is laid out very clearly on each card. They usually give you resources or allow you to build without spending resources. Once played, the card is removed from the game.</li>
                    <li>Victory point cards are the best development cards you can acquire. Keep them hidden if you want to win with a surprise victory. But beware as they could be stolen.</li>

                <p>
                    There are two types of trading in Catan: domestic and maritime.
                    <br>
                    Domestic:
                    <li>Domestic trading is trading between you and other players. You can announce what you’re after and what you’d be willing to trade for it. The other players can make counter offers and proposals to you but not to each other on your turn.</li>
                    Maritime:
                    <li>Maritime trading allows you to trade four of one good for one of another. You can perform this action this no matter what, but if you have a settlement or city on a harbour, you get a rebate of some kind based on the token - such as being able to trade at 3:1 or sometimes even 2:1 for a specific resource.

                    Victory in Catan is simple you just need 10 Victory points
                    They can be acquired by various things
                    <li>Settlement - 1 Victory Point</li>
                    <li>City - 2 Victory Point</li>

                        <li>2. Immediately play a development card (each time you buy a development card)</li>
                        <li>3. Place a knight (each time you play a "Knighthood" or a "Swift Knight" development card)</li>
                        <li>4. Move your knights (at the end of your turn, after you finish trading and building)</li>
                        <li>5. Expel the barbarians (at the end of your turn, after moving your knights)</li>

                        1. Barbarian Attack:
                        (Proceed as follows)
                        <li>Roll the dice until you get a result that is not a "7" (re-roll as many times)
                            Then place a barbarian on the coastal hex with the number token of the dice roll result.
                            If this coastal hex already has 3 barbarians, do not place a barbarian or re-roll the dice.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Roll the dice until you get a result that is not "7" and is not the same as the first result.
                            Then use this dice result to place a barbarian as outlined above.
                        </li>
                        <li>Roll the dice until you get a result that is not "7" and is not the same as either
                            of the first two dice roll results. Then use this dice roll result to place a barbarian as outlined in the 1st procedure.

                        <li>3 barbarians on a coastal hex means the token should be faced down</li>
                        <li>It no longer produces resources when you roll its number. You no longer place barbarins on this hex during an attack</li>
                        <li>You may not build a road on a path adjacent to a conquered hex</li>
                        <li>You may not build a settlement on an intersection adjeacent to conquered hex</li>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        3. A settlement or city is conquered
                        <li>As soon as a city is not adjacent to an unconquered hex. It is conquered</li>
                        <li>You get no victory points for a conquered settlement/city</li>
                        <li>If a conquered settlement/city has a harbour, you cannot use it</li>
                        <li>Since the desert hex and castle hex can never be conquered, a settlement or city adjacent to one of these cannot be conquered</li>

                        <li>Then place the 3 trade hexes. The sea side of each trade hex must match up with the sea side of each frame.
                            Do not use the following 3 hexes from the base game: desert hex, 1 pasture hex and 1 fields hex.
                        </li>
                        <li>Do not place number tokens on the 3 trade hexes - remove the "2" and "12" number tokens from play. 
                            Place the remaining number tokens as specified. Skipping the trade hexes.
                        </li>
                        <li>Arrange the commodity tokens into 3 stacks sorted by pictures on their backs (castle, quarry, glassworks). Shuffle
                            each stack and place it with the backs facing up (showing the picture of a building) beside the corresponding

                        <li>You can only carry out one delivery at a time. Only after this is done may you draw another commodity token</li>

                        <li>Turn the top card of that stack over and place it on the top of your baggage train card.</li>

                        The barbarians:
                        <li>When moving past, your movement cost is 2 more than normally required</li>
                        <li>If you upgrade your train card at least once, you can attempt to drive off the barbarian. Roll one die.</li>
                        <li>"7" is rolled: you must move one of the 3 barbarians to any path not already occupied by a barbarian. If moved to  a path occupied by a road. You may draw a resource card (not gold) from the owner.

                            . The edges of frame pieces bordering sea hexes or terrain hexes are also considered as sea routes.

                        Settlements and Settlers:
                        <li>You can build settlements in 2 ways: either along a road or by landing a settler ship</li>
                        <li>Building a settler costs the same resources as building a settlement</li>
                        <li>When you build a settler, you must place it either into the empty basin of one of your harbour settlements or directly
                            into the empty hold of one of your ships. Which must be located on a sea route adjacent to one of your harbour settlements
                        </li>
                        <li>A ship with a settler in its hold is called a settler ship</li>
                        <li>If the spaces in the habour basin and in an adjacent ship's hold are occupied by another game piece
                            , you can build the settler only if you remove the other game piece from the basin or hold and return it to your supply.
                        </li>
                        <li>You are not allowed to move a settler overland. Your settlers can only be transported by your ships</li>
                        <br>
                        Movement Phase: Loading a settler
                        <li>If either end of your empty ship points toward one of your harbour settlements with a settler
                            , you may load the settler onto the ship. You can move your settler ship like a regular ship
                        </li>
                        <li>If either end of your settler ship points toward the corner of a terrain hex. You may also build
                            a settlement there.
                        </li>
                        <li>To build this settlement, return both your ship and the settler in its hold to your supply</li>
                        <li>Place your new settlement on the intersection of the terrain hex, at no additional cost</li>

                        You win this scenario if you reach 8 victory points on your turn. Overall, this is an expansion that requires careful planning in both movement
                        and resource tracking. The beauty of this expansion of Explorers and Pirates is that each scenario can be used with other scenarios to further enhance
                        gameplay. For instance, involving scenario 2 of adding pirates and pirate lairs. All of which can be found in the Explorers & Pirates book!
